# Description
A mod using Artificial Beings Framework (ABF) and Synstructs Core (ABF:SC) to bring martial synstructs to RimWorld. Synstructs have long been integrated into human societies, including its violent tendencies. Synstructs who take a shine to battle partake in the martial traditions of humanity, and often find themselves desiring a more purpose-built body. No one lives forever, but their battle-ready frames sure make an attempt at it.


## Features
* Three races of humanlike-intelligence synstruct models for production:
    * The warrior, a dirt-cheap and expendable combat model. Warriors can be drones or reprogrammable drones, and exist almost entirely to fight and die. They weren't designed to die, though, so they generally are pretty effective at fighting.
    * The bishop, a complex and efficient model. Bishops can be drones, reprogrammable drones, or sapient individuals, and form a powerful core for any military expedition, militia, or security team. Their unusual six limbs that act as both arms and legs and their shape can be both blessing and curse.
    * The paladin, a mighty war-fighting model. Paladins can only be sapient individuals, and uphold strange and almost ancient customs in their own unique social environment. A fierce unit that becomes increasingly tough the more damage it takes, paladins aren't difficult to damage but are incredibly difficult to defeat.
* Two races of humanlike-intelligence "synstructs" that can be recruited but not produced:
    * The jellyman, a mysterious and unsettling blob of mechanites that takes a vaguely humanoid form with full sapience. Contained with the fluid membrane of their body is a mass of flesh that is gives them psychic power - a unique trait among synstructs - capable of utilizing most any psychic device. Capable of hardening in response to damage, ejecting mechanites to outright disable hostile targets in melee, free from coolant or lubricant needs and completely immune to all temperature, jellymen are widely considered the pinnacle of synstructs. They have almost nothing in common with them, and yet stubbornly demand to be called synstructs. The method for their creation is unknown, even to themselves, and can be found only rarely when crashing to the planet from space. What they were doing up there in the first place, they have no idea.
    * The juggernaut, a massive testament to synstruct engineering and a lack of creativity. Widely derided as the ultimate folly of man, these massive units can only have basic drone intelligences - less than that of bishops or warriors - and are so expensive and maintenance-heavy that they require a significant chunk of even interplanetary imperial economies just to keep fully operational. They're entirely unserviceable on a RimWorld, but undeniably dangerous. Why there are so many juggernauts floating around in space waiting for a targeting beacon to be used to call them to raise havoc is unclear - a mystery that many Ultratech societies have spent years researching to no avail. Who is distributing those call-down beacons for them is also a mystery, but one that few who have the honor of using one cares to ponder.
* Research and recipes to unlock and manufacture the models.
* Unique weapons that only the juggernaut may use (and are the only weapons it is capable of using).
