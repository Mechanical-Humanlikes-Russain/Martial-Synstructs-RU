		<description>Paladins were the first sapient synstructs idealized, blueprinted, and created by synstruct researchers alone, and is as unique as it is aesthetically lacking in the form of a rectangular prism with two forward arms and four large manipulators. Those synstruct researchers were later publicly scolded by their own kind for creating such a cold, heartless, and ultimately bland design.</description>
